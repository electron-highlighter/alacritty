# alacritty

Theme for Alacritty terminal

## Installation

This depends entirely upon whether the version of Alacritty you are running uses the `yml` config or the `toml` config. At some point they switched to `toml`, so if you are a regular Alacritty user that's likely what you have.

The instructions are the same - copy and paste the appropriate config file `electron-highlighter.{toml|yml}` file into your config.
